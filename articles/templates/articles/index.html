<h1>Joseph's Musings</h1>

<div class='container'>

    <p>This section is for my personal musings. I like discussing my various hobbies and this is a good way to express myself as well.</p>
    <p>Nothing here should be taken too seriously. If you would like to offer any constructive criticism or discuss anything you read, please contact me via the link at the bottom.</p>
