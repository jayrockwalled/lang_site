<h3>Lessons Learned from Building this Website</h3>
<div class='container'>

<div class='catch'>How I Benefitted from Struggling / Self Learning</div>

<p>I originally started learning about web development in August, 2018. I already liked the idea
    of having my own website to show off various projects as well as having an outlet for my 
    self-expression. All CS students from my undergrad has their own personal websites that they'd 
    put on their resume so I assumed it would be pretty easy. Despite starting with almost no knowledge
    of web development, I thought I'd be able to grind through it in a week or two.
</p>
<p>It was actually far from easy and ended up taking much more time than I thought it would. Counting
    time spent learning about new tools, building the website, troubleshooting, and figuring out hosting,
    I'd say this took easily more than 200 hours. During those 200 hours, I learned a lot about doing 
    development as well as a lot about myself.

<h5>1. Google is my best friend</h5>

<p>Using the correct keywords, the solution to almost all of my issues were a single Google search 
    away. What I would have thought would take hours reading through documentation never lasted more
    than an hour.

<h5>2. Anaysis paralysis is Real</h5>

<p>For any given problem or project, there're likely a plethora of solutions or means. Finding the most 
    optimal path takes <i>a lot</i> of research. There were times I spent many hours looking into 
    different tools and libraries, racking my brain to figure out the absolute best way of getting 
    the task done. When I was trying to find the best way to host this site, I looked into AWS, Azure,
    Digital Ocean, and other hosting services. I got so deep in the research that I was constantly 
    doubting myself and hesitating before getting to the next step. It took me a while to realize 
    that the analysis was becoming counter productive and it would be best to just pick whichever is 
    convenient and works best for me.

<h5>3. Learning is satisfying again</h5>

<p>In college, I always wanted to finish my assignments as quickly as I possibly can. Any extra time
    spent struggling on homework problems meant less time participating in my hobbies or hanging out 
    with friends. I absolutely <i>hated</i> to struggle on a problem longer than I deemed was 
    necessary.
</p>
<p>Working through this, I did not see it as a struggle. It felt more like one big learning experience
    in which I was felt engaged. I did not see troubleshooting through code or deciphering error messages
    as an obstruction like I used to. I saw it as all a part of the process to become a more skilled
    programmer.
