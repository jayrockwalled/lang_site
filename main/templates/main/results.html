                how important a word is when it appears in a sentence. This is calculated by measuring
                how often a word is used in the corpus and how often it appears in a document. A similarity 
                score closer to one indicates stronger similarity.
            </p>
            <p class="jumbotext">A TFIDF close to 1 indicates the word is very relevant and frequently used
                in the community.
